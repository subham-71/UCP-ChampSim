# Code Explanation:

We have maintained the least recently used (LRU) replacement policy for each partition assigned to the core (cpu). If the partition size needs to be increased for a particular core say C1, i.e. the new partition size is greater than the current partition, then the algorithm will check for availability in some other core say C2 whose new partition size is less than the current partition assigned to it. So the last recently accessed way from C2 will be assigned to C1 and accordingly allotted as MRU at that stage. <br /><br /><br />
We have created Auxiliary Tag Directory (ATD) to maintain in the form of UMON-global. We have maintained a vector to count the number of hits for each way, and also a variable to maintain total accesses. Our repartition algorithm follows the greedy approach based on the Utility-based Cache Partitioning research paper.<br />

As we can see by using the repartitioning technique we have improved the Instructions per Cycle (IPC) count. We also observed a similar pattern when we executed the same code with 2 or 8 cores and different traces as can be observed from the results section. <br /> <br />


Major changes have been done in the following files: <br />
replacement/lru.llc_repl - LRU replacement policy for each core (FUCNTIONS: llc_initialize_replacement, llc_find_victim, llc_update_replacement_state)<br />
src/main.cc - Repartitioning algorithm (LINE: 506-542 & 903-904)<br /> 
src/cache.cc - Declaration and initialisation of ATD (umonglobal, totalacceses, etc) and increasing the counter based on read and write hits in LLC  (LINE: 4-6, 247 & 546)<br />
